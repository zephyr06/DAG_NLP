#TODO:
1. DBF Jacobian all 0, but error is not 0
- the interval that causes error has been eliminated
--> When performing elimination, we should check whether some variables that depend on it
--> probably, current recover can't handle multiple dependency relationship well
2. some some error from DBF simple won't go away(v18, delta 1e-1)
