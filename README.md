# TODO:
1. Gradient vanish problem
2. Initialize fully with RM
3. Event hain analysis
- ErrorDimension = final job's instances
- direct modeling: back-ward propogation to get event chain's response time
- helper modeling: derive necessary condition for each instance, and add barrier function to them


test todo:

- * interval cover occurs at later stages *
---> solution: do not initialize with big overlap error
- Test v35 for DBF zero error


# Recent results:


# IDEA
- DIVIDE the solution space appropriately, like cliques in bayes tree
