#TODO:
1. DBF Jacobian all 0, but error is not 0
- the interval that causes error has been eliminated


test todo:

- * interval cover occurs at later stages *
---> solution: do not initialize with big overlap error


# Recent results:


# IDEA
- DIVIDE the solution space appropriately, like cliques in bayes tree
